# FastTrackML for Movie Recommndation: Accelerating Training and Testing

In the field of ML, tracking experiments efficiently and quicklgy is crucial for developing robust systems. This is especially true in the field of movie recommendation, where ML-powered models directly impact user engagement and satisfaction. In this blog post I'll introduce FastTrackML, an open source tool designed to make experiment tracking faster and more efficient.

## The Problem: Keeping Track of Machine Learning Experiments

As machine learning practitioners, we face a common challenge that is managing and tracking experiments. When building a recommendation system for a movie streaming service, this challenge becomes particularly acute as data scientists often face a need to:

1. Compare multiple model variants with different hyperparameters
2. Track training and validation metrics across iterations
3. Document choices of parameters for reproducibility
4. Visualize model performance to make informed decisions
5. Share results with team members

Without proper tools, teams often resort to spreadsheets, naming conventions, or scattered documentation. As the complexity increases, this approach quickly becomes unsustainable.

## Introducing FastTrackML

FastTrackML is a high performance experiment tracking tool designed as a replacement to MLflow's tracking server. Its aimed to accelerate the speed of logging, retrieval, a swell as visualizing, hence the name FastTrackML. 

Here are some of its key features:
- API compatible with MLflow that allows for easy integration with pre-existing codebase
- Combined visualization UI from MLflow and Aim
- Performance optimized for large-scale ML experiments
- Simple setup and deployment

The tool addresses the common pain point that as experiments grow in number and complexity - the task of tracking servers can quite often slow down - and FastTrackML is able to solve this through a design that is centered towards optimal performance. 

## Implementing FastTrackML for the tracking of Movie Recommendation System experiment

Let's see how FastTrackML can help a movie streaming service optimize its recommendation system. In this example, we'll use a dataset of user ratings for movies to build and track numerous different recommendation models.

### Setup

FastTrackML can be installed and run easily with command 'pip install fasttrackml'. You can run it by typing and entering 'fml server' on terminal, and from then the UI will be accessible from  UI is accessible at http://localhost:5000.

## Using FastTrackML for Movie Recommendations 

For our movie streaming service, I used FastTrackML to track experiments while building a recommendation system. Here's how it helps: 
1. Tracking different model configurations: I trained three variants of a matrix factorization model with different numbers of latent factors (20, 50, and 100) and FastTrackML made it easy to log these configurations
2. Logging performance metrics: For each model variation, I tracked key metrics like Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error, which measure how accurately the models predict user ratings. 
3. Visualizing results: FastTrackML's UI provides clear visualizations that make it easy to compare models side-by-side and determine which configuration performs best. 

For our movie recommendation system, the visualization clearly showed that the model with 20 components achieved the best balance of performance and simplicity with an RMSE of 3.71. FastTrackML also helped analyze our dataset characteristics, logging important information like the number of users (69,979), number of movies (24,770), and rating distributions. This information is valuable for understanding user behavior patterns in our streaming service.

The tool's integration with the MLflow API means we didn't need to modify existing workflows significantly, making it easy to adopt.

## Strengths and Limitations

### Strengths

1. **Performance**: FastTrackML - as the name suggests - provides faster logging and retrieval compared to vanilla MLflow, particularly with large datasets

2. **Ease of integration**: Since it is merely a replacement for MLflow, it requires minimal changes to existing code

3. **Simple deployment**: Installation and setup are straightforward, making it accessible for teams of all sizes

### Limitations

1. **Too recent**: Being relatively new, FastTrackML may not have the same level of community support or extensive documentation as more established tools

2. **Dependency on MLflow API**: While being compatible with MLflow is a strength, it also means FastTrackML is limited by MLflow's API design

3. **Limited cloud integration**: Currently, integration with cloud services is not as extensive as some commercial alternatives

## Conclusion

For movie streaming services dealing with recommendation systems, FastTrackML offers a good solution for experiment tracking. Its performance focus makes it particularly valuable when dealing with large-scale recommendation models and datasets.

In our movie recommendation scenario, FastTrackML helped us:
1. Track multiple model configurations effectively
2. Visualize performance differences between models
3. Analyze dataset characteristics
4. Make informed decisions about model selection

If MLflow is already being used by you and aim to optimize performance, or if you're setting up experiment tracking for the first time, FastTrackML is definitely worth considering.
